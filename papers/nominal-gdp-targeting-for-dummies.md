Nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) targeting is a type of monetary policy that people like me think would give us a more stable economy than we currently have. It would replace the Bank of England’s current monetary policy, inflation targeting. Nominal GDP can be understood as sum of all spending in the economy. Total spending can increase either because of price rises (inflation) or because there’s more stuff to go around (economic growth). If this year inflation is 2% and we have 2% economic growth, nominal spending (nominal GDP) will have risen by 4%.

The current policy of inflation targeting means that the Bank of England tries to control the money supply so that prices rise, on average, by 2% every year. If prices rise by more or less than this, the Bank is judged to have failed in its job.

Nominal GDP targeting would mean that the Bank of England would stop trying to target price rises, and instead try to target the total amount of nominal spending that takes place in the economy. That means that if economic growth was lower than usual, the Bank would have to try to make inflation higher than usual. If economic growth was higher than usual, inflation would be lower than usual.

This system is appealing because it is often the total amount of spending in the economy that matters, rather than inflation per se. Wages are usually set in nominal terms, which means that they do not automatically adjust upwards and downwards according to inflation.

Because of this, a drop in the amount of spending going on can lead to a mismatch between all the wage demands in the economy and the amount of money available to pay them. In other words, there is not enough money in the economy to pay everyone. This has two possible outcomes: either wages can be cut to meet the new level of spending, or people will have to be fired.

Empirically, it seems as if firms prefer to fire some workers than to cut wages across the board. In fact, firms really hate cutting wages, for some reason, and unemployed people are often reluctant to take the same job that they once had for a lower wage. Economists refer to this phenomenon as “sticky wages”.

So the outcome of a fall in total spending is usually unemployment. This is an example of a nominal change having a real effect, and destroys wealth that need not be destroyed, because the previously-profitable relationship between the worker and the firm has now been undone.

When this happens across the economy it can affect economic growth. In fact, this seems to be a very important factor in recessions – when there is a steady level spending taking place, the market is pretty good at finding new ways of using unemployed workers fairly quickly. When there just isn’t enough spending going on, we have to wait for workers and firms to cut wages enough to hire them again, which can take a long time.

Under nominal GDP targeting, the Bank of England would commit to keep the spending level growing even if economic growth dipped. As I've said, that would mean more inflation in times of slow growth and less inflation in times of quick growth.

Because inflation is being used to offset the changes in economic growth, negative economic ‘shocks’ like oil crises will translate into higher prices, prompting the market to adjust to take account of new realities, but never creating the domino effect of mass unemployment that we sometimes currently experience. The real economy would still adjust to real shifts in supply and demand, but we’d avoid the chaos that unstable monetary environments can create.

The key is that almost all contracts in the modern economy are set in nominal terms. That means that money that is managed in the wrong way can create a lot of unnecessary destruction of wealth. Nominal GDP targeting would probably give us the most neutral monetary system possible with the government, with the monetary environment kept stable so the real economy can do its work in allocating resources.

Money matters. The 2008 crisis happened because expectations of inflation, and hence nominal spending levels, dropped sharply, causing the ‘musical chairs’ problem of too little money to fulfil all the existing contracts and wage demands, which led to widespread bankruptcies and job losses. Today, the UK and the US have begun to get their spending levels growing at a healthy rate again, and their real economies have begun to grow healthily again too.

The Eurozone is the saddest story. The European Central Bank has been obsessed with fighting inflation (possibly because Germany has not suffered much, and Germans have bad memories of hyperinflation during the 1920s), and as a result nominal spending has grown very slowly indeed. The consequences are easy to see: in the weaker European economies, like Greece, Spain and Italy, unemployment is at historically high levels. It seems likely to stay there for many years.

Many people, myself included, believe that a system where private banks could issue their own notes without a central bank at all would be the best system. This is known as ‘free banking’. One of the best arguments for free banking is that it would keep nominal spending levels steady, because banks would issue more notes during periods of slow growth and fewer notes during periods of high growth. This should sound familiar – nominal GDP targeting is probably the closest we can get to ‘stateless’ money while having a central bank.

Nominal GDP targeting would not prevent all recessions or guarantee growth. The real economy is what determines things like that. But badly-managed money can destroy growth, create recessions by itself, and turn small ‘real’ recessions into extremely bad depressions, as happened in the 1930s and 2000s. Nominal GDP targeting would give us stable, neutral money that avoids these things. We would have been better off with it in 2008, and we would be better off with it today.

谷歌简易译本：

以名义国内生产总值（GDP）为目标是一种货币政策，像我这样的人认为，这将为我们提供比目前更稳定的经济。它将取代英格兰银行当前的货币政策，即通胀目标制。名义GDP可以理解为经济中所有支出的总和。总支出可能由于价格上涨（通货膨胀）而增加，或者因为还有更多的东西要走（经济增长）而增加。如果今年的通货膨胀率为2％，而我们的经济增长率为2％，那么名义支出（名义GDP）将增长4％。

当前针对通货膨胀的政策意味着英格兰银行试图控制货币供应，以使价格平均每年上涨2％。如果价格上涨幅度大于或小于此幅度，则银行将被判定工作失败。

以名义GDP为目标将意味着英格兰银行将停止试图以物价上涨为目标，而是以经济中发生的名义支出总额为目标。这意味着，如果经济增长低于正常水平，世界银行将不得不试图使通货膨胀率高于正常水平。如果经济增长高于通常水平，那么通货膨胀率将低于通常水平。

该系统之所以具有吸引力，是因为通常重要的是经济支出总额，而不是通货膨胀本身。工资通常以名义价格设置，这意味着它们不会根据通胀自动向上和向下调整。

因此，持续的支出额减少会导致经济中所有工资需求与可用于支付这些需求的货币数量之间不匹配。换句话说，经济中没有足够的钱支付所有人。这有两个可能的结果：要么可以削减工资以满足新的支出水平，要么必须解雇人员。

从经验上看，似乎公司更愿意解雇一些工人，而不是全盘削减工资。实际上，由于某种原因，公司真的讨厌削减工资，失业的人通常不愿接受以前曾经为降低工资而做的同样的工作。经济学家将这种现象称为“固定工资”。

因此，总支出下降的结果通常是失业。这是名义上的改变具有实际作用的一个例子，它破坏了不需要消灭的财富，因为工人与公司之间先前有利可图的关系现在已经被撤销。

当这种情况在整个经济中发生时，可能会影响经济增长。实际上，这似乎是衰退中的一个非常重要的因素-当支出保持稳定水平时，市场非常擅长于迅速找到使用失业工人的新方法。当没有足够的支出进行时，我们必须等待工人和公司削减工资以再次雇用他们，这可能需要很长时间。

根据名义GDP目标，即使经济增长下降，英格兰银行也将致力于保持支出水平的增长。就像我说过的那样，这意味着增长缓慢时通货膨胀率较高，而增长迅速时通货膨胀率较低。

由于通货膨胀被用来抵消经济增长的变化，石油危机之类的负面经济“冲击”将转化为更高的价格，促使市场进行调整以考虑到新的现实，但从未造成大规模失业的多米诺骨牌效应。有时当前经验。实体经济仍将适应供求的实际变化，但我们要避免不稳定的货币环境可能造成的混乱。

关键是现代经济中几乎所有合同都是以名义价格订立的。这意味着以错误方式管理的金钱会造成很多不必要的财富损失。以名义GDP为目标可能会给我们提供与政府尽可能最中立的货币体系，同时货币环境保持稳定，以便实体经济能够进行分配资源的工作。

金钱很重要。2008年的危机之所以发生，是因为对通货膨胀的预期以及由此而来的名义支出水平急剧下降，从而导致了“音乐椅”问题，即资金太少而无法履行所有现有合同和工资要求，从而导致广泛的破产和失业。今天，英美两国的支出水平再次开始以健康的速度增长，其实体经济也开始健康增长。

欧元区是最可悲的故事。欧洲中央银行一直沉迷于抗击通货膨胀（可能是因为德国遭受的损失不大，而德国人在1920年代对恶性通货膨胀的记忆犹新），因此名义支出的确增长非常缓慢。后果显而易见：在希腊，西班牙和意大利等较弱的欧洲经济体中，失业率处于历史高位。似乎可能会在那里呆很多年。

包括我本人在内的许多人认为，私人银行完全不用中央银行就可以发行自己的票据的系统将是最好的系统。这就是所谓的“免费银行业务”。自由银行业务的最佳论据之一是，它将保持名义支出水平稳定，因为银行在增长缓慢的时期会发行更多的票据，而在增长迅速的时期会发行较少的票据。这听起来应该很熟悉-名义GDP目标可能是我们拥有中央银行时最接近“无国籍”资金的目标。

以名义国内生产总值（GDP）为目标无法防止所有衰退或保证增长。真正的经济决定了这种事情。但是，管理不善的资金可能会破坏经济增长，独自造成衰退，并将小规模的“真正”衰退变成极端严重的萧条，就像1930年代和2000年代那样。名义GDP目标将为我们提供稳定，中立的货币，避免这些情况。在2008年，我们会过得更好，而今天，我们会过得更好。
