Public cryptonetworks have some unique features that put them in an ambiguous position vis-à-vis existing legal and administrative systems, especially governments.

First, as decentralized networks without single points of control, they lack a natural geographic or jurisdictional home. Second, many of the proposed use cases for these networks overlap with activities that have historically been closely associated with state power. And third, since cryptonetworks represent a genuine institutional innovation, there is little precedent or experience to build on when trying to determine their legal status and thereby the appropriate regime for their regulation.

What should governments make of these emerging systems, and how might their societal role evolve in a cryptonetworked world? On the one hand, crypto represents an important and effective tool against authoritarianism, and certain aspects of it can arguably be framed as competitive with the State. On the other hand, it is also possible to envision a more symbiotic relationship in which well-intentioned governments are both active participants in and direct beneficiaries of public cryptonetworks.

Max Weber famously defined the state as a human community that lays claim to the legitimate use of physical force in a given territory — a monopoly on violence. But equally important for the effectiveness and sustainability of governmental power is the legitimate use of symbolic authority. This is evident in the state’s ability to establish rules, enforce contracts, define formal terms and standards, maintain official records, and empower institutions that have the final say in all sorts of legal and business matters. It is in this second realm of authority where cryptonetworks have the potential to effectively complement or even replace certain functions traditionally associated with governments, and more recently, with large tech corporations as global leaders in information technology.

While exclusive and continual access to large amounts of data is no doubt lucrative, both politically and financially, it is also becoming a widely acknowledged security concern and possibly a liability too heavy and dangerous to be borne by any single organization. The idealized vision of scalable cryptonetworks is to address this issue by building an alternative infrastructure for administering information, one that is highly secure and reliable, easily accessible to anyone in the world, and that offers individual users unprecedented control and autonomy over their data and interactions. This would mean disintermediating and automating various essentially bureaucratic functions that today require specialized human labor, or result in the accumulation of personal data in centralized organizations where it is often handled with little regard towards privacy or the power imbalance between users and service providers.

But such a vision leaves plenty of room for mutually beneficial collaboration between decentralized networks and centralized organizations, including governments. Forward-thinking network builders can open up new opportunities by engaging constructively with state institutions and seeking ways to test-integrate cryptonetwork services with existing systems without abandoning their basic principles of decentralization. Conversely, governments can reduce their bureaucratic overhead by supporting the buildout of a globally interoperable administrative infrastructure independent of the whims of any single nation or private corporation. Ideally, such collaboration would result in more reliable, efficient and secure public services, and instead of undermining the mandate and legitimacy of national governments, would actually amplify their capabilities for participating in global governance in which cryptonetworks are expected to acquire an increasingly important role.

It may take a while to reach a point where decentralized networks provide systemically important services in a way that traditional institutions find impossible to compete with, or become comfortable enough to actively participate in. But work on a number of compelling networks is well underway (see Placeholder’s portfolio for examples), and each new experiment will improve our understanding of where a global and decentralized solution makes sense, and where we’re better off sticking with more local and centralized systems. Either way, the relationship between the two, although complex, is not always or necessarily contentious.

 # 加密网络与治理
 
 
 公共密码网络具有一些独特的功能，使它们与现有的法律和行政系统（尤其是政府）处于模糊的位置。
 
   首先，作为没有单一控制点的分散式网络，它们缺乏自然的地理或管辖权。其次，这些网络的许多拟议用例与历史上与国家权力密切相关的活动重叠。第三，由于密码网络代表了真正的制度创新，因此在试图确定其法律地位以及适当的监管制度时，没有什么先例或经验能够建立起来。
   
   政府应该对这些新兴系统做些什么，以及它们的社会角色如何在密码网络世界中发展？一方面，加密代表了一种反对威权主义的重要而有效的工具，它的某些方面可以说是与国家竞争。另一方面，也可以设想一种更加共生的关系，善意的政府既是公共密码网络的积极参与者，也是公共密码网络的直接受益者。
   
   马克斯·韦伯（Max Weber）将该州定义为一个人类社区，该社区声称在特定领土内合法使用武力 - 垄断暴力。但同样重要的是政府权力的有效性和可持续性是象征权威的合法使用。这一点在国家制定规则，执行合同，确定正式条款和标准，维护官方记录以及授权在各种法律和商业事务中具有最终发言权的机构方面具有明显的效果。正是在这第二个权威领域，密码网络有可能有效地补充甚至取代传统上与政府相关的某些功能，最近，大型科技公司成为信息技术的全球领导者。
   
   虽然在政治上和财务上对于大量数据的独占和持续访问无疑是有利可图的，但它也成为广泛认可的安全问题，并且可能是任何单个组织承担的过重和危险的责任。可扩展密码网络的理想化愿景是通过构建用于管理信息的备用基础架构来解决此问题，高度安全可靠，世界上任何人都可以轻松访问，并为个人用户提供前所未有的数据和交互控制和自主权。这将意味着中介和自动化各种基本上官僚主义的功能，这些功能现在需要专门的人工，或者导致个人数据在集中式组织中的积累，而这些组织通常很少考虑隐私或用户与服务提供商之间的权力不平衡。
   
   但是这样的愿景为权力下放的网络和包括政府在内的中央组织之间的互利合作留下了充足的空间。具有前瞻性思维的网络建设者可以通过与国家机构进行建设性的接触，并在不放弃其分散化基本原则的情况下，寻求将密码网络服务与现有系统进行测试整合的方法，从而开辟新的机遇。相反，政府可以通过支持全球互操作的行政基础设施的建设来减少其官僚主义开销，而不受任何单一国家或私人公司的影响。理想情况下，这种合作将产生更可靠，更有效和更安全的公共服务，而不是破坏国家政府的授权和合法性，
   可能需要一段时间才能达到分散网络以传统机构无法与之竞争或足够舒适以积极参与的方式提供系统重要服务的程度。但是，许多引人注目的网络的工作正在顺利进行（参见占位符的组合示例），每个新实验将提高我们对全球和分散解决方案的理解位置的理解，以及我们最好坚持使用更多本地和集中式系统。无论哪种方式，两者之间的关系虽然复杂，但并不总是或有争议的。
